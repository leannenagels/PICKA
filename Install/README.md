# PICKA Installation procedure

This document describes how to install PICKA on your machine.

## Prerequisites

* You are supposed to have been granted access to the Google Drive repository where PICKA is available. Note that the Github only contains the source code, but not the audio and visual resources.

* You need to have a Google Drive folder, locally, on your machine, synchronized with the online resource. In other words, you need to install Google Drive for desktop â€” now called "Backup and Sync", or "Drive File Stream" (https://www.google.com/drive/download/). When you setup Google Drive, you can specify that you want to synchronize only one directory (it is advisable to have only the PICKA directory synchronized on your test machine). Also, by default, Google Drive will synchronize your Pictures and Videos directory. Better untick that before you start synchronizing. Now wait for Google Drive to download everything. (Note for Linux users: there are third party software that can synchronize with Google Drive, otherwise, just download the PICKA folder as a zip file, unzip it, and treat this as your Google Drive folder... but obviously you won't be able to sync results with this method.)

* You need to have Matlab, R2015b or newer, with the signal processing toolbox.

* You also need to have Python 2.7 installed (__not Python 3__). At this time, on Mac and Linux, this is the case by default. On Windows, you will need to download and install the latest release of Python 2.7 (https://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.14/python-2.7.14.amd64.msi). To make sure it works, in Matlab, type `pyversion` and see if it points to the right version. Then, to check if loading the Python engine works properly, run `py.print('It works!')`. If there is no error message, you're good to go!

* You need around 2 GB of free space.

## Installation

In the Google Drive directory, navigate to the `Install` folder (where this README should be), and copy the setup file appropriate for you:

* setup_nl.m for tests in Netherlands Dutch.

* setup_gb.m for tests in British English.

You only need to copy that one file.

Once the file copied, paste it to directory where you want to install PICKA. *Not* in the Google Drive.

Open Matlab, navigate to that directory and execute the setup script and follow the instructions. You will be asked to select the Google Drive directory, and then the installation directory (which should be the current directory). Once you've made sure that the source and destination directories are correct, type "yes" to start the installation.

If all went well, that's it! You've installed PICKA! See the general manual for details on how to run the experiments.

## After the installation

You need to do two things after the installation: pre-process the stimuli, and calibrate.

Pre-processing the stimuli will not only speed up the experiment, but it will also make a more accurate calibration. To run the pre-processing of all stimuli, run:

```matlab
>>> preprocess_picka();
```

That may take a while...

To run the calibration, run:
```matlab
>>> calibration();
```

See the calibration section in the main PICKA [README](../README.md) for details.
