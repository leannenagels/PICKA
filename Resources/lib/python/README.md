This folder contains a few Python libraries and scripts that are used in PICKA.

The original of sqlShort can be found at https://github.com/egaudrain/sqlShort. The PICKA version has been modified to remove the dependence to Numpy.

The Python package xlwt is used to generate MS Excel files and can be found here: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/xlwt.
